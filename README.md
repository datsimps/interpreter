# Interpreter

## The Project
This is an interpreter built in Rust following:
"Writing an interpreter in Go" by Thorsten Ball

With the book being written in Go, I am loosely converting it in Rust. So if you
are following the book and it looks different than mine, that's why. For anyone who
is trying to do the same, use this as you need and good luck. If you get confused (as 
I definitely did, I included the "update.txt" to work through the Pratt Parser. It's 
how I learn things, break it down. I hope it helps.

The project is about learning what an interpreter does and the process in which
it goes about completing its task. It has taught me a great deal about:
 - Tokens
 - Lexers
 - Testing the code base 
 - Parsing
 - Abstract Syntax Trees
 - Pratt Parsing
 - Strategies of evaluation
 - And so on

## The Tools
Language used: Rust

## The Purpose
  The goal is to learn about interpreters. It has always seemed like a magic box 
so I found a teacher and went for it. It has been a blast seeing how things are 
actually done.
